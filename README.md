### Overview

Euphonic-Electronica is a pet project of Anjuna fanboy Shreyas Chaudhari. I have been following Anjunadeep since almost episode no 40. As on today, unless I go back and check when the spisode was published; I would not even remember since when I have been following Anjunadeep.

Needles to say, I'm a big fan of this group. Everytime when the episode of Anjunadeep is / was broadcasted, I had a routine which I used to follow. 

First step for me after the episode was broadcasted was to check if the episode was uploaded to SoundCloud. Majority of times, because of the difference in the time zone, I used to missout the live broadcast. Episode uploaded to the SoundCloud used to be a big relief.

Next step is whenever I was listening the episode on SoundCloud, trying to find out the names of the tracks. I tried using Shazam numerous times but majority of times, it was of no use. Then came the 1001Tracklists. Since then, finding the ID of the song was always easy.

Over the period of time, I had developed another hobby where in if the artist is relatively new to the Anjunadeep label, then I used to look out for the artist on Spotify, Twitter & Facebook. Look out for the hit tracks, any festival performance etc and then try to find the new tracks of the artists as well.

I have created this application as a one stop solution to all the aboves problems. This is a standalone application where in for every Anjunadeep episode, a SoundCloud link, the tracklist list on 1001Tracklist and then the Spotify, Facebook, Twitter profiles of the artist are coalated.
